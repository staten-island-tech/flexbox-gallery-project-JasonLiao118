              <h3 class="blurb">As you can see this is my first very hot meme. As a Shrek fan, I have to say that I am jealous of his moist abs. In the movie, he has demonstrated his strength through beating up dragons and short men. I believe that all men who think they are men should aspire to be like this man as his manliness can be sensed through the screen of whatever you watch the movie on. Here is a very hot video demonstrating what he can do.</h3>

                 <h3 class="blurb">As you can see this is my second meme. If you can see a common theme thorugh these memes, you are a true man. Disclaimer, I do not know the man in this picture. While he shares the resemblence of a true man, I cannot guarentee that he has a junk under the trunk. Here is another very hot video demonstrating true men.</h3>
